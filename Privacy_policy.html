        addresses, etc.).</p>


        <h3>Revocation of your consent to the processing of data</h3>
        <p>A wide range of data processing transactions are possible only subject to your express consent. You can also
            revoke at any time any consent you have already given us. To do so, all you are required to do is sent us an
            informal notification via e-mail. This shall be without prejudice to the lawfulness of any data collection
            that occurred prior to your revocation.</p>

        <h3>Right to object to the collection of data in special cases; right to object to direct advertising (Art. 21
            GDPR)</h3>
        <p>IN THE EVENT THAT DATA ARE PROCESSED ON THE BASIS OF ART. 6 SECT. 1 LIT. E OR F GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO
            AT ANY TIME OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA BASED ON GROUNDS ARISING FROM YOUR UNIQUE
            SITUATION. THIS ALSO APPLIES TO ANY PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. TO DETERMINE THE LEGAL BASIS, ON
            WHICH ANY PROCESSING OF DATA IS BASED, PLEASE CONSULT THIS DATA PROTECTION DECLARATION. IF YOU LOG AN
            OBJECTION, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA, UNLESS WE ARE IN A POSITION TO PRESENT
            COMPELLING PROTECTION WORTHY GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING OF YOUR DATA, THAT OUTWEIGH YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS
            AND FREEDOMS OR IF THE PURPOSE OF THE PROCESSING IS THE CLAIMING, EXERCISING OR DEFENCE OF LEGAL
            ENTITLEMENTS (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21 SECT. 1 GDPR).

            IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS BEING PROCESSED IN ORDER TO ENGAGE IN DIRECT ADVERTISING, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO AT
            ANY TIME OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA FOR THE PURPOSES OF SUCH ADVERTISING. THIS
            ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING TO THE EXTENT THAT IT IS AFFILIATED WITH SUCH DIRECT ADVERTISING. IF YOU OBJECT,
            YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR

            DIRECT ADVERTISING PURPOSES (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21 SECT. 2 GDPR).</p>

        <h2> Right to log a complaint with the competent supervisory agency</h2>
        <p>In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects are entitled to log a complaint with a supervisory
            agency, in particular in the member state where they usually maintain their domicile, place of work or at
            the place where the alleged violation occurred. The right to log a complaint is in effect regardless of any
            other administrative or court proceedings available as legal recourses.</p>

        <h2>Right to data portability</h2>
        <p>You have the right to demand that we hand over any data we automatically process on the basis of your
            consent or in order to fulfil a contract be handed over to you or a third party in a commonly used, machine

            done only if it is technically feasible.</p>

        <h2>SSL and/or TLS encryption</h2>
        <p>For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as purchase orders or
            inquiries you submit to us as the website operator, this website uses either an SSL or a TLS encryption
            programme. You can recognise an encrypted connection by checking whether the address line of the browser
            switches from „http://“ to „https://“ and also by the appearance of the lock icon in the browser line.

            If the SSL or TLS encryption is activated, data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.</p>

        <h2>Information about, rectification and eradication of data</h2>
        <p>Within the scope of the applicable statutory provisions, you have the right to at any time demand
            information about your archived personal data, their source and recipients as well as the purpose of the
            processing of your data. You may also have a right to have your data rectified or eradicated. If you have
            questions about this subject matter or any other questions about personal data, please do not hesitate to
            contact us at any time at the address provided in section „Information Required by Law.“</p>

        <h2>Right to demand processing restrictions</h2>
        <p>You have the right to demand the imposition of restrictions as far as the processing of your personal data
            is concerned. To do so, you may contact us at any time at the address provided in section „Information
            Required by Law.“ The right to demand restriction of processing applies in the following cases:

            In the event that you should dispute the correctness of your data archived by us, we will usually need some
            time to verify this claim. During the time that this investigation is ongoing, you have the right to demand
            that we restrict the processing of your personal data.
            If the processing of your personal data was/is conducted in an unlawful manner, you have the option to
            demand the restriction of the processing of your data in lieu of demanding the eradication of this data.
            If we do not need your personal data any longer and you need it to exercise, defend or claim legal
            entitlements, you have the right to demand the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead
            of its eradication.
            If you have raised an objection pursuant to Art. 21 Sect. 1 GDPR, your rights and our rights will have to be
            weighed against each other. As long as it has not been determined whose interests prevail, you have the
            right to demand a restriction of the processing of your personal data.

            If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these data – with the exception of their
            archiving – may be processed only subject to your consent or to claim, exercise or defend legal entitlements
            or to protect the rights of other natural persons or legal entities or for important public interest reasons
            cited by the European Union or a member state of the EU.</p>

        <h1>4. Recording of data on this website</h1>
        <h3>Cookies</h3>
        <p>In some instances, our website and its pages use so-called cookies. Cookies do not cause any damage to your
            computer and do not contain viruses. The purpose of cookies is to make our website more user friendly,
            effective and more secure. Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer and stored by your
            browser.

            Most of the cookies we use are so-called „session cookies.“ They are automatically deleted after your leave
            our site. Other cookies will remain archived on your device until you delete them. These cookies enable us
            to recognise your browser the next time you visit our website.

            You can adjust the settings of your browser to make sure that you are notified every time cookies are placed
            and to enable you to accept cookies only in specific cases or to exclude the acceptance of cookies for
            specific situations or in general and to activate the automatic deletion of cookies when you close your
            browser. If you deactivate cookies, the functions of this website may be limited.

            Cookies that are required for the performance of the electronic communications transaction or to provide
            certain functions you want to use (e.g. the shopping cart function), are stored on the basis of Art. 6 Sect.
            1 lit. f GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in storing cookies to ensure the technically
            error free and optimised provision of the operator’s services. If a corresponding agreement has been
            requested (e.g. an agreement to the storage of cookies), the processing takes place exclusively on the basis
            of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR; the agreement can be revoked at any time.

            If other cookies (e.g. cookies for the analysis of your browsing patterns) should be stored, they are
            addressed separately in this Data Protection Declaration.</p>

        <h3>Contact form</h3>
        <p>If you submit inquiries to us via our contact form, the information provided in the contact form as well as
            any contact information provided therein will be stored by us in order to handle your inquiry and in the
            event that we have further questions. We will not share this information without your consent.

            The processing of these data is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR, if your request is related to the
            execution of a contract or if it is necessary to carry out pre-contractual measures. In all other cases the
            processing is based on our legitimate interest in the effective processing of the requests addressed to us
            (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f DSGVO) or on your agreement (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a DSGVO) if this has been requested.

            The information you have entered into the contact form shall remain with us until you ask us to eradicate
            the data, revoke your consent to the archiving of data or if the purpose for which the information is being
            archived no longer exists (e.g. after we have concluded our response to your inquiry).</p>

        <h3>Request by e-mail, telephone</h3>
        <p>If you contact us by e-mail or telephone, your request, including all resulting personal data (name,
            request) will be stored and processed by us for the purpose of processing your request. We do not pass these
            data on without your consent.

            The processing of these data is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR, if your request is related to the
            execution of a contract or if it is necessary to carry out pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the
            processing is based on your consent (Article 6 (1) a GDPR) and/or on our legitimate interests (Article 6 (1)
            (f) GDPR), since we have a legitimate interest in the effective processing of requests addressed to us.

            The data sent by you to us via contact requests remain with us until you request us to delete, revoke your
            consent to the storage or the purpose for the data storage lapses (e.g. after completion of your request).
            Mandatory statutory provisions – in particular statutory retention periods – remain unaffected.</p>

        <h3>Processing of data (customer and contract data)</h3>
        <p>We collect, process and use personal data only to the extent necessary for the establishment, content
            organization or change of the legal relationship (data inventory). These actions are taken on the basis of
            Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. b GDPR, which permits the processing of data for the fulfilment of a contract or
            pre-contractual actions. We collect, process and use personal data concerning the use of this website (usage
            data) only to the extent that this is necessary to make it possible for users to utilize the services and to
            bill for them.

            The collected customer data shall be eradicated upon completion of the order or the termination of the
            business relationship. This shall be without prejudice to any statutory retention mandates.</p>

        <h1>5. Plugins and Tools</h1>
        <h2>Google Web Fonts</h2>
        <p>To ensure that fonts used on this website are uniform, this website uses so-called Web Fonts provided by
            Google. When you access a page on our website, your browser will load the required web fonts into your
            browser cache to correctly display text and fonts.

            To do this, the browser you use will have to establish a connection with Google’s servers. As a result,
            Google will learn that your IP address was used to access this website. The use of Google Web Fonts is based
            on our interest in presenting our online content in a uniform and appealing way. According to Art. 6 Sect. 1
            lit. f GDPR, this is a legitimate interest.

            If your browser should not support Web Fonts, a standard font installed on your computer will be used.

            For more information on Google Web Fonts, please follow this
            link: https://developers.google.com

            services on by submitting the online job application form). Below, we will brief you on the scope, purpose
            and use of the personal data collected from you in conjunction with the application process. We assure you
            that the collection, processing and use of your data will occur in compliance with the applicable data
            privacy rights and all other statutory provisions and that your data will always be treated as strictly
            confidential.</p>

        <h2>Scope and purpose of the collection of data</h2>

            communications data, application documents, notes taken during job interviews, etc.), if they are required
            to make a decision concerning the establishment or an employment relationship. The legal grounds for the
            aforementioned are § 26 New GDPR according to German Law (Negotiation of an Employment Relationship), Art. 6
            Sect. 1 lit. b GDPR (General Contract Negotiations) and – provided you have given us your consent – Art. 6
            Sect. 1 lit. a GDPR. You may revoke any consent given at any time. Within our company, your personal data
            will only be shared with individuals who are involved in the processing of your job application.

            If your job application should result in your recruitment, the data you have submitted will be archived on
            the grounds of § 26 New GDPR and Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. b GDPR for the purpose of implementing the employment
            relationship in our data processing system.</p>

        <h2>Data Archiving Period</h2>
        <p>If we are unable to make you a job offer or you reject a job offer or withdraw your application, we reserve
            the right to retain the data you have submitted on the basis of our legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1
            lit. f DSGVO) for up to 6 months from the end of the application procedure (rejection or withdrawal of the
            application). Afterwards the data will be deleted, and the physical application documents will be destroyed.
            The storage serves in particular as evidence in the event of a legal dispute. If it is evident that the data
            will be required after the expiry of the 6-month period (e.g. due to an impending or pending legal dispute),
            deletion will only take place when the purpose for further storage no longer applies.

            Longer storage may also take place if you have given your agreement (Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR) or if statutory
            data retention requirements preclude the deletion.</p>
